/*
  A "google_project_iam_binding" only updates one particular role. If someone is added
  manually to that role (s)he will be removed when the Terraform config is applied.
  If someone is added to a role that is not listed in our Terraform config, that mapping
  will not be affected when the config is applied.

  The alternative would be to use the "google_project_iam_policy" resource which is
  "authoritative" on the project level meaning anything that is not in our Terraform
  config will be remove when it is applied. I think the risk of unintended consequences
  outweighs the extra security that will bring. Example: locking us out of the project
  or messing with Google controlled service accounts whose permissions are set up a bit
  under-the-hood.
