# The rationale for having these two parallel environments is that the Phoenix microservices
# need two separate environments for System Integration and Staging. In our case, it doesn't really
# make sense to create a whole new project just for Staging so we deploy both the pipelines and
# the buckets/datasets/topics they need in turing-app-367309.
